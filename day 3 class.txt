First we have to create git account 
sign in to that account by using personal mail id 
after creating new account we have to create new repository 
we have to give repository name and select public or private and create new repository and repository get created we have to copy the link 



        now we have to go to git bash and as we are doing first time we have to initialise so use git init command 
          now .git folder will create if we want to see .git folder we have to use ls-a command

          after that git add . --->means to add multiple files
                     or 
                     git add file name ---->for one perticular file
          every time we have to check our status by using git status command
                   |
                   |
                   |
           git commit -m "first"
                   |
                   |
           git config --global user.email "chintakavithareddy@gmail.com"
           git config --global user.name "kavitha"
           git commit -m "first"
           git status 
     if we add or create a new folder just we have to git add . and git commit -m "any name" usethis commands and checking status 
 


      now we have to create new token and we have to copy the token link and paste it somewhere when we crete git account we have on url link 
   now we have to combine both urls and push that as push - origin master
